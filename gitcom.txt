Hello folks
Roshan is a lazy and idiot guy.
git status -> will show if any changes is made .
git add . -> will bring everything on the stage for commit in the current directory
git commit -m "comments" -> will commit all the staged items leaving some comments for history.
git restore --staged file_name -> will remove all the things from the stage
git restore file_name -> will bring back the deleted file
git stash -> will put everything to the back of stage in case we need it later to commit but not for now. We won't even know if that thing existed prior.
git stash pop -> will bring back everything from the back of stage in unstaged state even though those were staged while stashing them.
git stash clear -> will clear the back of stage without keeping any track, deleting them forever.
