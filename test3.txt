this file test3.txt is being staged together with test2.txt
new line is being added here when test3.txt is already staged but not commited yet. It means git is already tracking it.
Restoring files from staged area to working area (untracking the file) won't remove the registered SHA1 hash for the files nor changes the content of file whether
the file is staged right after created for the first time or modified after being staged.
git restore --staged <filename>
This command won't affect the content of the file in the working directory but only its place is changed from staged to working directory. Here we are talking
about staging and working and repo area which are with respect to Git.
